    <h1>experience</h1>

    <p>
      Most of my experience has been in people-facing roles where the work involves
      responding in real time — answering questions, helping things run smoothly,
      and adjusting communication depending on the situation.
    </p>

    <p>
      Over time, this has made me comfortable reading context, making small judgment
      calls, and working in environments where things move quickly and aren’t always
      predictable.
    </p>

    <p>
      Studying neuroscience has shaped how I approach this work. Learning about
      attention, stress, and decision-making has made me more aware of how tone,
      clarity, and timing affect how people experience a space.
    </p>

    <p>
      I’m currently interested in work that sits at the intersection of community,
      communication, and digital culture.
