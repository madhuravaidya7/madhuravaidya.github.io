    <h1>experience</h1>

    <h2>so far</h2>
    <p>
      Most of my experience has been in environments where working directly with people
      is central to the role.
    </p>
    <p>
      I’ve spent time in student-facing and administrative settings, supporting people
      in shared spaces and responding to questions or issues as they come up. This kind
      of work made me comfortable adjusting how I communicate depending on context,
      pace, and the person in front of me.
    </p>
    <p>
      I’ve also worked in more structured, institutional environments, where accuracy,
      discretion, and clear communication mattered. Across these settings, I’ve gotten
      used to reading situations quickly and helping things run smoothly when there’s
      a lot happening at once.
    </p>

    <h2>right now</h2>
    <p>
      I’m currently finishing my BSc in neuroscience, which shapes how I think about
      digital culture and communication.
    </p>
    <p>
      I’m especially interested in attention, emotion, and decision-making, and how
      those processes show up in online spaces. I tend to notice how people interact
      with content, what holds attention, what gets ignored, and how tone or timing
      changes the way something is received.
    </p>
    <p>
      Outside of school and work, I keep up closely with pop culture and current events,
      and I spend a lot of time around collective, fast-moving spaces. Playing music,
      practicing taekwondo, and following baseball, soccer, and hockey have all
      influenced how I think about group dynamics, energy, and shared norms.
    </p>

    <h2>in the future</h2>
    <p>
      I’m interested in work that involves community, digital culture, and thoughtful
      communication.
    </p>
    <p>
      Longer term, I’d like to contribute to work that feels meaningful and grounded in
      everyday life — ideally in a walkable place, with room for balance, curiosity,
      and a few cats.
    </p>
    <p>
      I enjoy connecting with people and learning how different spaces function. If
      you’d like to talk more or see a fuller overview of my background, I’m always
      open to connecting.
